# Combat Pattern System Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The combat pattern system has been completely refactored to address the complexity issues and make it more maintainable. The key improvements include:

1. **Unified Pattern System**: Created a generic pattern system that works for both player and enemy patterns
2. **State Machine Integration**: Fully leveraged the state machine approach for pattern management
3. **Centralized Counter-spell Logic**: Moved counter-spell logic to a dedicated module
4. **Pattern-Specific Implementations**: Separated pattern-specific code into dedicated files
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant code across files
6. **Improved Maintainability**: Made it easier to add new patterns in the future

## New Files Created

1. **patterns_registry.h/c**: Central registry for all patterns
2. **counter_spell.h/c**: Dedicated counter-spell system
3. **pattern_types/electric_pattern.h/c**: Electric pattern implementation
4. **pattern_types/hide_pattern.h/c**: Hide pattern implementation
5. **pattern_types/sleep_pattern.h/c**: Sleep pattern implementation
6. **pattern_types/open_pattern.h/c**: Open pattern implementation
7. **pattern_types/bite_pattern.h/c**: Bite pattern implementation
8. **pattern_types/enemy_electric_pattern.h/c**: Enemy electric pattern implementation

## Modified Files

1. **patterns.h**: Enhanced Pattern struct with callbacks and owner type
2. **statemachine.h/c**: Enhanced state machine to better handle patterns
3. **character_patterns.c**: Refactored to use the new pattern system
4. **enemies_patterns.c**: Refactored to use the new pattern system
5. **combat.c**: Updated to work with the new pattern system

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Pattern Structure

The Pattern struct now includes:
- Pattern identifier
- Owner type (player or enemy)
- Callback functions for pattern-specific behavior
- Recharge time for enemy patterns

```c
typedef struct Pattern {
    u16 id;                     // Pattern identifier
    bool active;                // Whether pattern is available
    u8 notes[4];                // Sequence of notes for this pattern
    u16 owner_type;             // OWNER_PLAYER or OWNER_ENEMY
    u16 recharge_time;          // Time before pattern can be used again (for enemies)
    bool (*can_use)(void);      // Function to check if pattern can be used
    void (*launch)(struct StateMachine*);    // Function to launch pattern effect
    void (*do_effect)(struct StateMachine*); // Function to process ongoing effect
    void (*finish)(struct StateMachine*);    // Function to finish effect
    Sprite *sd;                 // Sprite data for pattern visualization
} Pattern;
```

### 2. Pattern Registry

The pattern registry provides a central place to register and retrieve patterns:

```c
void pattern_registry_init(void);
void register_pattern(Pattern* pattern);
Pattern* get_pattern(u16 pattern_id, u16 owner_type);
u8 validate_pattern_sequence(u8* notes, bool* is_reverse, u16 owner_type);
```

### 3. Enhanced State Machine

The state machine has been enhanced to better handle patterns:

```c
typedef struct StateMachine {
    // Existing fields...
    
    // Enhanced pattern system
    u16 owner_type;                // OWNER_PLAYER or OWNER_ENEMY
    u16 entity_id;                 // ID of the entity (player or enemy)
    u16 active_pattern;            // Currently active pattern ID
    bool is_reversed;              // Whether current pattern is reversed
    bool is_counter_spell;         // Whether current pattern is a counter-spell
    
    // Pattern system
    PatternSystem pattern_system;
    
    // Pattern callbacks
    EffectCallback launch_effect;  // Function to launch effect
    EffectCallback do_effect;      // Function to process effect
    EffectCallback finish_effect;  // Function to finish effect
    
    // Validation functions
    bool (*validate_pattern)(u8* notes, bool* is_reverse);
    void (*pattern_complete)(struct StateMachine* sm, u16 pattern_id, bool is_reverse);
} StateMachine;
```

### 4. Counter-spell System

The counter-spell system centralizes all counter-spell logic:

```c
bool can_counter_spell(u16 player_pattern, u16 enemy_pattern, bool is_reverse);
void execute_counter_spell(StateMachine* player_sm, StateMachine* enemy_sm, u16 pattern_id);
void handle_counter_spell_result(bool success, u16 enemy_id, u16 pattern_id);
```

### 5. Pattern-Specific Implementations

Each pattern now has its own implementation files with standard callbacks:

```c
bool electric_pattern_can_use(void);
void electric_pattern_launch(StateMachine* sm);
void electric_pattern_do(StateMachine* sm);
void electric_pattern_finish(StateMachine* sm);
```

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Reduced Complexity**: The code is now more organized and easier to understand
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Adding new patterns is now much simpler
3. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Pattern-specific code is now separated from the core system
4. **Centralized Logic**: Common functionality is now centralized in dedicated modules
5. **Consistent Interface**: All patterns now use the same interface for callbacks
6. **Easier Debugging**: Issues are easier to isolate and fix

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the refactored system to ensure it works as expected
2. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
3. **New Patterns**: Consider adding new patterns now that the system is more maintainable
4. **Performance Optimization**: Look for opportunities to optimize performance
5. **Code Cleanup**: Remove any remaining deprecated code once the new system is stable

## Conclusion

The refactored combat pattern system is now much more maintainable and extensible. The state machine approach has been fully leveraged, and the code is now better organized with clear separation of concerns. This should make it much easier to add new patterns and fix bugs in the future.
