**The Weave** is a new retro game currently in development. Set a century after the classic adventure *Loom*, it aims for an interesting story, wellâ€‘written characters and a weekend-length adventure that does not require lightning reflexes.

The engine is being created from scratch in C using [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) and the graphics are being replaced with hand crafted pixel art.

## Features

- Cinematic cutscenes with dialogues in English and Spanish.
- Puzzle solving with magic spells and interactable objects.
- Many magic patterns with musical notes you will unlock during the adventure.
- Numerous new characters, guilds and locations.
- Spells combat with various enemies.
- Game engine from scratch using SGDK.
- **Tech demo now available!**

## Development status

A first playable version of Act One (with both English and Spanish text) is hopefully expected by the end of 2025. The game will be **free** and the **source code** will be available on GitHub.

### Wanted: graphic artists!
